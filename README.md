## MAVLink ##

MAVLink -- Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library.

MAVLink is a very lightweight, header-only message library for communication between drones and/or ground control stations. It consists primarily of message-set specifications for different systems ("dialects") defined in XML files, and Python tools that convert these into appropriate source code for [supported languages](https://mavlink.io/en/#supported_languages). There are additional Python scripts providing examples and utilities for working with MAVLink data.

> **Tip** MAVLink is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth. Its reference implementation in C is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.

## Usage

1. Modify custom dialect in `message_definitions/v1` folder.
2. Run following command:
    ```bash
    python3 -m mavgenerate
    ```

    On `Out`, define output dialect file path.For example, to output the new dialect file `sense` to
    folder `custom_dialects`:
    Out == custom_dialects/sense
